## Gettting Started

- You need `git` installed to clone this repo
- You need `nodejs` and `npm` installed on your machine to serve this app
- Optionally you can serve this app using `xampp` on a php localhost server or `Apache` server

To serve this app with `serve` on localhost use `npx serve .` and visit on <https://localhost:5000> `5000` is the default port for serve unless you specify another port.
